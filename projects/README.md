## Copyright Note
Some of the projects here contain Texas Longhorns or UT ECE logos. Those are properties of University of Texas at Austin. Any PCBs that I put those logos on are purely for academic use at UT ECE. If you download my designs from this repo for your personal use, you might want to remove these logos in case UT lawyers call you up to have a cup of tea.
